# Clank-release
A Game made for the **Global Game Jam 2022** with friends (MaÃ«lle Fromont, Luc Castelain, Valentin Rapine and Corentin Aubrun). 


## Speech :

Will you be brave enough to venture into the depths of the caves or will you stay safely on the surface? Will you be able to come up fast enough or will you give in to the temptation of the treasures that are buried in the bowels of the earth?  Will you dare to fight the dragon that lies there and risk perishing with all your gold ? Face your own greed by amassing the most fortunes and flee with your treasure!


## Rules :

In **Clank**, you play as a treasure-seeking adventurer travelling through a cave. Your goal is to retrieve an artifact and return to the surface with as much loot as possible. However, a dragon lurks, and the noise you make while performing actions and moves is represented by *Clanks*. 

### Your deck:

You play solo and each round you draw 5 cards from your deck. These cards give you Action points (blue), Movement (represented by boots) and Fight action (represented by swords) points. These points allow you to buy cards from the available cards (9 in all). The blue cards you buy are added to your deck. You can then draw them on your next turns. The red cards are monsters. If your Sword score is high enough, you can fight them. These cards are not added to your deck, but the effects on the card apply immediately. One move point is equivalent to moving one square on the board. Beware, stopping on ice caves sets your move counter to 0 for that turn. Some icons on the links between squares have special effects. The "step" icon costs 2 movement points to cross that path, while the monster icon will cost you a sword, or 1 life point if you have no sword left. You cannot cross paths with a lock if you do not have a key. At the end of your turn, press the "end turn" button to draw 5 new cards from your deck.

### The market :

A market is located on the 4 central squares. You can buy 3 types of items there. They all cost 7 gold coins. Keys unlock locks, backpacks allow you to get a 2nd artefact and crowns give you 10 points at the end of the game. Keys and backpacks score 7 points.

### The dragon :

The more noise you make, the more likely you are to attract it! Certain cards or actions you play or take will add clanks to a pool. When the Dragon attacks, your Clanks are added to a pool of neutral points and 3 of them are drawn at random. If one of your clanks is drawn, you lose a life! So the more you add, the more likely you are to die quickly! A Dragon Attack is triggered if, at the end of the turn, one of your purchased cards is replaced by a card with the "Dragon Attack" symbol (monsters or actions with the dragon head on the right).

### Endgame:

If you surface with at least one artifact, you gain 20 extra points. If you resurface or die, all your victory points divided between the items you bought, the cards in your deck, your books of secrets, your artefact(s) and your other items add up. It's up to you to get the highest score!
